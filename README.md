# Java Fundamental Programs 

This repository contains a collection of Java programs written during my Class 11–12 ISC board preparation using BlueJ.

These programs helped me build my foundations in Java and include a wide variety of logic-based problems categorized neatly.

## 📁 Program Categories
- 🔢 **Numbers** – Prime, Armstrong, Disarium, Palindrome, etc.
- 🧵 **Strings** – Reverse, Vowel Count, Palindrome, etc.
- 📊 **Arrays** – Max, Min, Search, and more
- 📚 **Miscellaneous** – Day to date converter,Binary Search,and more

## 💡 Features
- Beginner-friendly Java code
- Clear method structure and comments
- No GUI – purely logic-based for clarity

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Add descriptions & sample outputs
- Refactor old programs using functions
- Revisit with OOP concepts & file handling
